## What is Game Shop?

Game Shop is a simple website that you can purchase recent games. Our website has 4 pages. These pages include a shop, basket, login, and item information page. Users can register using their emails and admins can empty local storage from the login page using the special code 1234. On the shop page, users can view products and filter vendors from the sidebar. In Game Shop users can display information of the desired games using the info button and can add multiple games to the shopping basket (Same or different games). After choosing the basket from the navigation users can remove any item from the basket and complete their purchases from the checkout button.
